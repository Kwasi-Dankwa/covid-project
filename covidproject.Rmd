# Covid19 EDA Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes a COVID-19 dataset containing daily and cumulative numbers of tests, cases, recoveries and deaths by country. 

I will use dplyr and data visualization with ggplot2 in R. Other techniques  I will employ include filtering data, aggregating daily to cumulative numbers, and scaling statistics to population level

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#load library
library(readr)

covid_df <- read_csv("covid19analysis.csv")
head(covid_df)
```


```{r}
#view dimension of dataset
library(dplyr)
dim(covid_df)
vector_cols <- colnames(covid_df)
glimpse(covid_df)
```

```{r}
#filter and clean dataset by find countries with universal data and removing province state column
covid_df_all_states <- covid_df %>% filter(Province_State == "All States") %>%
  select(-Province_State)
print(covid_df_all_states)

```

```{r}
#selecting columns related to cumulative measures and daily measures

covid_df_all_states_cumulative <- covid_df_all_states %>% select(Date, Continent_Name, Two_Letter_Country_Code, positive, hospitalized, recovered, death, total_tested)
print(covid_df_all_states_cumulative)

covid_df_all_states_daily <- covid_df_all_states %>% select(Date, Country_Region, active, hospitalizedCurr, daily_tested, daily_positive)


```
```{r}
#Identifying countries with highest number of deaths
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
covid_df_all_states_cumulative_max <- covid_df_all_states_cumulative %>%
  group_by(Continent_Name, Two_Letter_Country_Code)%>%
  summarize(max_deaths = max(death, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(max_deaths > 0) 
  print(covid_df_all_states_cumulative_max)
```

## Plotting maximum death for each country
```{r}
ggplot(covid_df_all_states_cumulative_max, aes(x = Two_Letter_Country_Code, y = max_deaths, color = Continent_Name )) + geom_point()

#storing top 3 affected countries in character vector
top_3_death <- c("United States", "United Kingdom", "Italy")
```

```
```
```{r}
#Extracting top 10 cases 
covid_df_all_states_daily_sum <- covid_df_all_states_daily %>%
  group_by(Country_Region)%>%
  summarize(tested = sum(daily_tested), positive = sum(daily_positive),active = sum(active), hospitalized = sum(hospitalizedCurr))%>%
  arrange(desc(tested))

covid_top_10 <- head(covid_df_all_states_daily_sum,10)
print(covid_top_10)
```

#Which countries have highest number of positive cases against the number of tests
```{r}
# Extract the Country_Region column into the countries vector

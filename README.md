# covid-project
 Analyzing a COVID-19 dataset containing daily and cumulative numbers of tests, cases, recoveries and deaths by country. 
  
This analysis tries to provide answers to the following questions.

Which countries have had the highest number of deaths due to COVID-19?

Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?

Which countries have made the best effort in terms of the number of COVID-19 tests conducted related to their population?

Which countries were ultimately the most and least affected related to their population?

The goal of this project was to assess the impact of the Covid-19 virus in countries across the globe by filtering countries that collected data across all states.
